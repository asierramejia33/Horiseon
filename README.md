# Horiseon
As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards,
so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

We have gone through several iterations on our code to make this possible.
Every step has been docummented on the commit history and with comments, so that
future coders know about the changes being made and the reasoning behind.

You can find our website in the following link: [Horiseon by Andres Sierra](https://asierramejia33.github.io/Horiseon/)

You can also visit our GitHub Repository at: [Horiseon | GitHub Repository](https://github.com/asierramejia33/Horiseon/)
